# Standardise species names in alien species lists
A workflow to standardise and track changes to species names in alien species lists. This workflow was developed in the context of South Africa's National Status Report on Biological Invasions. Species names are standardised using one or a mix of three taxonomic backbones, those of the: Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), Botanical Database of Southern Africa (BODATSA), Plants of the World Online (POWO).
